    district: "Thimphu",
    description:
      "Nestled in a lush valley at 2,300 meters, Thimphu is Bhutan’s bustling yet deeply traditional capital. Unlike typical capitals, it lacks traffic lights (replaced by polite police in ceremonial dress) and prioritizes Dzong architecture even in modern buildings. The majestic Tashichho Dzong, seat of the government and monastic body, dominates the cityscape with its whitewashed walls and golden roofs. Wander through the Weekend Market, where farmers from across the region sell red rice, chili peppers, and handmade cheeses. The 51-meter-tall Buddha Dordenma statue radiates serenity atop Kuensel Phodrang Hill, while the Motithang Takin Preserve showcases Bhutan’s quirky national animal, the takin. By night, cozy cafes serve *suja* (butter tea) alongside surprisingly vibrant bars playing traditional *rigsar* music. Thimphu balances urban energy with spiritual calm, making it a gateway to Bhutan’s soul.",

      "Paro Valley, cradled by emerald rice paddies and snow-capped peaks, is the postcard-perfect face of Bhutan. Home to the kingdom’s only international airport – where pilots navigate narrow mountain passes – Paro is famed for the gravity-defying Tiger’s Nest Monastery (Paro Taktsang). Legend says Guru Rinpoche flew here on a tigress to meditate in the 8th century. The hike to the monastery winds past prayer flags and pine forests, rewarding visitors with cliffside views. Rinpung Dzong, a fortress-monastery straddling the Paro River, hosts the vibrant Paro Tshechu each spring. Don’t miss the National Museum, housed in a 17th-century watchtower, displaying ancient *thangkas* and ritual masks. Traditional farmhouses here serve *ema datshi* (chili-cheese stew) with warm hospitality. Paro’s timeless charm makes it a must-visit.",

The crown jewel is Punakha Dzong, a 17th-century fortress adorned with jacaranda trees that bloom purple in spring. Cross the longest suspension bridge in Bhutan (160 meters), swaying above rushing turquoise waters, to reach Chimi Lhakhang – the Fertility Temple, where phallus paintings adorn village homes in honor of the ‘Divine Madman’ Drukpa Kunley. Farmers here grow crimson-red rice and plump oranges, offering homestays where you can thresh grain or cook *kewa datshi* (potato-cheese curry).

The Burning Lake (Mebar Tsho) shimmers with myths of hidden treasures revealed by fire. In autumn, locals harvest buckwheat and brew fiery *ara* (rice wine).
